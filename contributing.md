# Read this before contributing

Hello and welcome to this library for complex numbers, here is some info you should know before contributing to this crate!

1.  Use `Foo::bar()` instead of `().bar` when using methods that are related to math, this makes more sense math notation wise, if it isn't math related, use whichever you want
2.  When implementing new math functions, mention what formula you used for all of them in the `formulas.typ` file. It is made in the markup language Typst, which is like LaTeX but actually nice to use, and doesn't require an excessive amount of boilerplate.
3.  The usage of Artificial Intelligence-generated code is strictly prohibited
